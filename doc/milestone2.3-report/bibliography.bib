    abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) is engaged
    in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in
    Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), an important ability that allows nuclear power
    plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing
    electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in MSRs produce unwanted byproducts
    (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In
    steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same
    rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts
    start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a
    buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again
    increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the
    byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive
    decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these
    unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load
    following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, MSRs transport fuel in a
    flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor,
    outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The
    team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts
    and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to
    commercialization for molten salt reactors.

    Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in
    August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of
    the Transatomic Power (TAP) MSR. A Python toolkit, SaltProc v0.1
    [1{\textendash}3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel
    salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR). More recently, an
    advanced SaltProc version (SaltProc v0.2) was developed to generically
    simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the TAP
    system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt
    processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards
    milestone M2.1: Demonstrate SaltProc and the steps toward the subsequent
    Task 2 objectives.},

    The current work introduces a reliable safety system based on control rods
    in addition to the online feed system reactivity control in the
    Single-fluid Double-zone Thorium-based Molten Salt Reactor (SD-TMSR). Three
    different initial fissile loadings are considered: 233U, reactor-grade Pu,
    and transuranic (TRU) elements as a startup fuel. We applied six different
    absorbing materials to investigate the main operational and safety
    parameters in the SD-TMSR: natural B4C, enriched B4C with 90\% 10B, HfB2,
    HfH1.62, Eu2O3, and Gd2O3. The present work focuses on control rod design,
    integral and differential control rod worth, shutdown margin, and shadowing
    effects at steady-state. We employed the SERPENT-2 Monte-Carlo code to
    calculate the reactivity worth and analyze the performance of the
    reactivity control system. We showed that 233U and reactor-grade Pu startup
    cores maintain adequate shutdown margin with all considered absorbers.
    Finally, this paper proposes a design of control rod clusters that
    compensate the excess reactivity of the SD-TMSR loaded with different
    initial fissile material.},
